# Computer-Inactivity-Prevention-Script-for-Windows-Powershell
# This is a simple powershell script for Windows machines, created in order to prevent  your PC/server from going to sleep mode due to inactivity.
# The script is designed to run for 480 minutes (8 hours) by default, but you can obviously change this to the calue of your choosing.
# The script by automatically pressing the SCROLL LOCK button every one minute (every 58 seconds to be exact).
# This button can also be changed, but, generally speaking at least, the SCROLL LOCK button is not really in use anymore, and this is wny it was chosen.
# The reason why I created this script is because there are various apps that move the mouse every few seconds, to achive the same result (prevent the computer from going to sleep), but this is actually # # problematic if you are working on the PC, and the mouse cursor moves while you are actually doing something with the mouse, causing you to click at the wrong place.
# The script is completely free to use.
